# IRCCloud-chrome-app

Chrome app so you can have IRCCloud in separate window (like a real program!)

## NOTE

I'm not using this at the moment as there is a way to create an app from any url in Chrome (Windows and ChromeOS only).
Here are the steps required to do that for Irccloud:

1. Bookmark Irccloud into your Bookmark bar
1. Right click bookmark bar and select "Show Bookmarks Bar" (to show bookmarks bar always)
1. Go to Apps list (chrome://apps)
1. Drag and drop the bookmark into App list
1. Right click the app and select "Open as Window"
1. Right click the app and select "Create Shortcuts"
1. Right click bookmark bar and unselect "Show Bookmarks Bar"
